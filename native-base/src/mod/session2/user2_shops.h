// P8 option U, step U2 case A (docs/research/s25/tiendas-u2.md, user2_shops_logic.h), HOST only:
// [session2] user2_shop_route = 0 (default) | probe | 1. The guest's OWN shop scenes far from the host: with U-1 armed
// (user2_stages=1) and user2_stages_elements=schedule+funcnpc - or, since S46 phase 3, user2_shop_trade_list=1 (T1:
// only smithy / butcher by the exact hash of the name, s46-tenderos.md §9) - user 2's manager prepares the
// cd_seq_funcnpc_* scenes of its cells (a 2661 to user 2, its M natively); this module sends that scene's Reqs to the
// manager that has it. Nothing here depends on which of the two keys let the scene through.
//   U2-a  user2_funnels' ServerField::vf48 detour, at the return address of each scene handler's own vf48 call
//         (user2_shops_logic.h kSites; the 2044 timer too): the Troc's sequencer id (its packet) live in user 2's
//         manager and not in the original answer -> user 2's manager. Any subject (only user 2's client knows those
//         ids: its 2661 goes ToTarget). The other vf48 of such a Troc are counted (the first of each (opcode, return)
//         is a WRN line, review M2), never changed.
//   U2-b  shop_probe's mid hook at 0x2126A1F (the server's 0x2126920, the 2671's entry check): the entry's stage id
//         [r13+0x20] live in user 2's manager -> RAX := user 2's manager (whoever asks).
//   hold  user2_stages' DISTANCE drain waits while user 2 is in a shop of its own scene (a 2916 of the shop
//         interaction 0x000F4321 right after a U2-b check of its own entry): at most 120 s, only while the players are
//         more than 5 cells apart, once per arm (review A1). Another field, its loads and its logout never wait.
//   probe: every decision counted and logged as "would", nothing routed. With user2_stages_elements=schedule+funcnpc
//         the shop scenes ARE prepared in probe too (review M1, the step A2): their Reqs then reach the host's
//         manager natively (lost, or a Nak) and the module says what it would have done.
// Requirements (else U-f lets no shop scene through): shop_probe=1 with its points S 0x2126A1F and P 0x288AAEF in,
// user2_funnels' vf48 / subject hooks, the call sites of 2436 / 2173 / 2767 verified (review B1).
// Abort criteria (mode 1 -> probe for the rest of the run, one ERR line): user2_shops_logic.h u2sh::Abort.
// The server runs its handlers on SEVERAL threads (review M3): everything here is atomics; the lookups are read-only
// replicas (a table changing under another thread gives "not found": not routed).
