// P8: user 2's rank permit on the host's client and the per-user owner
// funnels on the host's server (docs/research/pendientes/p8-sistemas-juego.md
// §11.1 and §11.7; the implementation, the verified bytes and the test plan:
// docs/research/pendientes/p8-impl-rango-embudos.md). HOST only.
//
// [session2] rank_permit / quest_per_user / kill_loot_per_user = 0 (default,
// nothing installed) | probe (count only) | 1 (user2_funnels_logic.h).
//
// A  rank_permit (the host's CLIENT, its AI threads). The two
//    `call [rax+0x188]` (FF 90 88 01 00 00) at 0x221E281 (0x221E110, before
//    GrantRankPermit 0x2220850) and 0x221F29F (0x221EF50, before the permit's
//    removal) become `call rel32` to a stub near them (`jmp [rip]` to
//    rank_vf188_thunk) + `nop`. The thunk calls the original vf188 (the only
//    game call) and, for dl = 5 and X = user 2's main character (its key and
//    its controller +0x90 = user 2's keys), answers 1 with rank_permit=1 when
//    X's target component [[X+0x68]+0x90] exists. Probe: counts only.
//    Written once with safetyhook::trap_threads (the page non-executable while
//    the 12 bytes change); both sites verified before either is written, the
//    first restored if the second cannot be written.
//
// B/C, the subject (the host's SERVER threads): an inline hook at ExecuteTroc
//    0x2774B20(int* res, Troc*, TrocParams* params) sets a thread_local
//    "subject = [params]" for the Req's duration when that actor is user 2's
//    main character (ServerNormalInGameActor exe+0x5B1DE20 with user 2's keys),
//    restoring the previous one on return (nesting).
// B  quest_per_user: inline hook at ServerField::vf40 0x2B00C70(field). With a
//    subject and [field+0x180] = the host's user (the shared field):
//    [[[subject+0x68]+0x138]+0x18] (vtables checked) instead of the owner's
//    ServerQuestManager; anything unreadable: the original.
// C  kill_loot_per_user: inline hooks at 0x2AFFF50(field, out) and at the
//    `jmp .xtls` stub 0x20DEE60(field, out) (the stub in .rsrc; .xtls is never
//    touched), each for ONE return address (0x29432E3, DeadActor 0x62; 0x2B83D29,
//    the loot recipient). Both fill a lock handle `out` (+8 object, +0x10 locked).
//    0x2AFFF50: the original is called with a field of the mod's whose +0x180
//    is user 2's user key (it reads nothing else of the field: 0x2AFFF78), so
//    the game itself looks user 2 up and locks its character. 0x20DEE60: the
//    original's FindUser 0x2A82590([[exe+0x6D696B8]], out, user 2's key), the
//    same lookup and handle vf40 uses, instead of the .xtls body.
// F3 user2_fast_travel (fast_travel_logic.h): vf48's detour, for the one return
//    address 0x2A5F7FC (the 2283 handler 0x2A5F580) under user 2's subject in the
//    shared field: [[[subject+0x68]+0xA8]+0x18] (ServerSequencerStageManager,
//    [mgr+0x18] == subject) instead of the owner's, so 0x2896120 / 0x2BC4950
//    write the destination into user 2's TransformSync+0x550; when that chain
//    cannot be read, a thread_local block whose +0x18 is the subject (0x2896120
//    reads only that). The second vf48 of the same Troc (0x2BC4C53, inside
//    0x2BC4950: a reference on [mgr+8] and [mgr+0x6A0] = 0) gets the same real
//    manager. Probe: logs only (and F2 drops every 2283 with it).
// Counters (probe and 1): per funnel, per Req opcode and per caller; vf48
//    0x2B00CE0 counted under a subject whenever B or C is on; FindUser
//    0x2A82590 counted only when B or C is `probe`. No lock, no allocation,
//    no log line on a game thread: relaxed atomics, a lock-free ring.
//
// When: only once the local player has been in the world for 3 s (as
// ui_pause), after the game's code matches build 1.0.0.2976 byte for byte.
// Its thread updates the keys every 100 ms, writes the ring's events every
// second and a summary every 60 s.
