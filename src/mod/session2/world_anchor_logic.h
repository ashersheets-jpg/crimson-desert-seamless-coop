// [session2] user2_world_anchor = 0 (default) | probe | 1, HOST only (create_session=1)
// (docs/research/noche/mundo-invitado.md, section "Implementado"): the pure logic of world_anchor.cpp, with no game
// access, so the tests can run it.
//
// The fault [V/E, build 1.0.0.2976]: the server's actor collector (pa::TrocTrActorGarbageCollectionRepeatTimer ->
// 0x2C37340, every 5 s) removes an NPC (RemoveActorAck 2516, reason 25) once it is out of its spawn radius
// (~200-230 m) from BOTH of its anchors: the field owner's character (the host) and the actor [field+0x2E8] when the
// byte [field+0x2E4] != 0 (0x2C38E28; the native "world observer", free in normal play). User 2 is no anchor: what
// surrounds it dies once it is ~250 m from the host.
//
// The fix: that second anchor is user 2's main character while user 2 stands in a field the host owns. The two slot
// fields are written DIRECTLY, never with the native UpdateWorldObserverStateReq 2245: its handler (0x29C2780) also
// calls 0x2836A20 on the field's ServerSyncSceneObjectManager ([field+0x80]), which empties and refills a set at
// manager+0x278 with the scene objects of its table +0x60 whose +0xB0 == -1 and +0x183/+0x187 != 0; only
// WorldObserverDisableLoadCompleteReq 3060 (0x29C2AB0, with the slot off) and the destructor empty it again, and no
// reader of it was found (static scan): an unknown side effect, so the report's alternative. The write is the
// handler's own (0x29C2915: byte +0x2E4, dword +0x2E8), on ServerRunThread (the OnRecvPacket hook that exists), under
// the field's own lock [field+8] (pa::WindowsRWLock<4,1>): its TryLock vf+0x28 (exclusive, never waits) and its
// Unlock vf+0x20, the same SRW lock the handler (vf+8/+0x10) and the collector (shared, 0x393DF0) take.
//
// When (all on ServerRunThread, evaluated at most every kWaitCheckMs while nothing is set, kWatchdogMs once set):
//   set    user 2 exists, its logout was not asked for, its move phase is Stable (its last load ended with the 2762
//          the server wrote for it) and that 2762 is newer than the last "leave" below, its main character key is
//          known (class 0xA, = its MainPlayerDataStartAck) and that character stands in an open field the host owns
//          ([field+0x180] = the host's user key: the shared field, or the old one after the host travelled away);
//          a slot holding another key that is not ours (a native world observer) is never taken.
//   leave  user 2's GameLoadingStartReq 2437, ReloadStageStartReq 2283 or LogoutSessionToServerReq 2001 reaches the
//          server: the slot is cleared first (at that packet's OnRecvPacket, before its handler runs) and the next set
//          waits for a newer 2762.
//   clear  the conditions no longer hold (user 2 gone without a 2001 = the fallback clear, another field, logout
//          asked...): cleared only while it still holds {1, our key} in the same field generation (SAM::FindActor has
//          no generation check: a stale key could anchor another actor).
//   watch  once set, the slot is read back every kWatchdogMs: lost (not {1, key}) -> set again (at most one per
//          kResetMinMs); held by a foreign key -> left alone (counted); the field closed (same generation) -> cleared
//          like any clear; the field reused (another generation) -> forgotten: Pool<ServerField>::Acquire (.xtls
//          0x1066CDB0) runs ServerField::Reset 0x2AF7360 on every field it hands out (generation + 1 under the
//          field's lock, then +0x2E4 = 0 at 0x2AF74B5).
// When it runs: only inside ServerNet::OnRecvPacket (ServerRunThread pops Q0 with a 1 s timeout and calls it per
// packet; the timers run on another thread): for the host's session as well as user 2's. The host client's own C>S
// keep it turning in play (S16/S22 host captures: after the login, gaps <= 1.8 s / <= 5.0 s, a 2469 every 5 s while
// idle; only its own loading screens are longer), so the watchdog and the fallback clear wait <= ~5 s, not for user
// 2's traffic.
// Field lifetime [E]: fields are pooled and reused in place (the pool's free list); the only free is the deleting
// destructor vf0 0x2AF6A40 (no direct caller: the pool's teardown with the server). [field+8] = field+0x1B8 is set
// once by the constructor (0x1434920) and never rewritten, so reading it and calling its TryLock is safe on any
// generation; open (+0x4A) and generation (+0x2C8) are checked again under the lock: a pooled field is closed
// (0x2AFEA00 sets +0x4A = 0; Reset with r8 = 0 does not reopen it), so a set never lands in a field being reused.
// probe: the same decisions, logged as "would", nothing written; the slot is only read.
