// Option D, C2-0 (docs/research/pendientes/identidad.md §5.2, §6 "Observación
// mínima"): a READ-ONLY probe of user 2's characterNo during its login, to
// decide whether normalising it after the component-load loop returns is a
// root fix. The host's server gives both characters 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, and
// the Status load writes that constant itself (.xtls 0x1042756B, after the
// common load 0x1791980), so the question is whether anything consumes or
// publishes the provisional number between the Status load and the return of
// the loop. Observation points, all in .rsrc (never .xtls):
//
//   load      0x20688A0 LoadComponentsFromFile(actor, res*, store, name,
//             u32 slot) -> res: entry and return, the characterNo before and
//             after, the result.
//   component 0x20693EB, mid hook right after each component's vf(+0x50)
//             call: component (R15), its vtable, the result (RAX = res*), the
//             characterNo at that moment. Gives the ORDER of the loads
//             relative to Status (vtable 0x5B203F0, +0x50 = 0x293FE70).
//   owner     0x2AE1010(component, u16* type, u64* no, u64* no2): builds an
//             owner of type 2 copying *Status+0x70; every call inside user
//             2's load or its login window, with the caller's address.
//   phases    0x2941020(obj, res*, ?, ?) -> res, actor [obj+8]: the
//             post-load login phases (called from .xtls 0x1042AC0C).
//   ack       0x28F31F0(actor): the login path that writes CharacterStatAck
//             2358 with the characterNo pointer (0x206A890 at 0x28F3489).
//   packer    0x17908C0(Status, archive): writes **(Status+0x70); filtered
//             to the login window first (it can be frequent).
//   version   0x1791B98 (server) / 0xB74302 (client), mid hooks on the two
//             writes of global 0x6C8CD98 (_currentRestoreCodeVersionXXX):
//             the old and the new value.
//
// Entry hooks only call the original with the same arguments and return its
// result; mid hooks only read registers and memory. Every point is checked
// against its bytes and goes in on its own; a point whose code differs stays
// off. "User 2's character": actor+0xA0 == session 2's validated user (or the
// actor IS that user, its lobby load); while session 2's user cannot be read
// yet, a user whose key is not the host's, said so in the line. During user
// 2's login window (or while its user exists) a load whose actor has no
// identified user is logged too, as "unidentified": whether the character's
// user link is set before its save loads is not proven. The host's character
// gets at most two comparison lines per point.
