// P8 S16, HOST: user 2's PlayAllPreLoadSequencerAck 2322 after a fast travel that RELOADS the shared field
// (docs/research/pendientes/p8-impl-viaje-rapido.md §12; the root cause: p8-s15-viaje-tunel.md). The pure logic of
// [session2] observer_milestone_reload = 0 | probe | 1, with no game access, so the tests can drive it.
//
// What it models (build 1.0.0.2976, RVAs; capstone on the read-only PE):
//   A reload trip of user 2 = its ReloadStageStartReq 2283 ACCEPTED BY F3 (the vf48 at 0x2A5F7FC answered user 2's
//   own manager or the block: user2_funnels), then its GameLoadingStartReq 2437 entering the server, answered by
//   0x2BCA3D0 with LoadingFieldDataAck 2643 + MoveFieldCompletePostAck 3066 and NO MoveFieldAck 2174 (a 2174 =
//   a field change: observer_milestone's entry path, never ours; a 2679 = refused).
//   The guest's client then sends PreLoadSequencerReq 2873 (0 bytes, load state 0x0D) and waits in state 0x11 for a
//   2322 naming ITS character (M+0x231 1 -> 2 at 0xB87A67). On the server the 2873's handler 0x2A5F2B0 -> .xtls
//   0x104D7F20 takes the field OWNER's manager (vf48, return 0x104D801E) and 0x2895EF0 -> 0x287EF60 re-prepares the
//   HOST's content sequencers and sends the 2322 to the host's character (0x287F1D4): user 2 never gets one.
//   Mode 1 (variant B, §12.2): the 2873 of a reload trip is DROPPED on the network thread (the host's sequencers are
//   left alone) and the 2322 for user 2's character is emitted ONCE on the server's thread, at the exit of user 2's
//   next ExecuteTroc at least kMinDelayUs after the drop, with observer_milestone's verified emitter (ToTarget
//   0x2A757A0 + 0x2999D80). Probe: the 2873 goes on (as today) and the same decision is logged ("WOULD").
//
// One reload trip = one F3 acceptance: R<gen>. At most ONE 2322 per trip; a native 2322 for user 2's character
// after its 2437, a 2174, a 2679, a new epoch or a logout end it without ours. Transient thread states (not the
// server realm, no send context, an open scope sender, inside take_frame, unreadable) are retried at the next Req,
// counted at most once per kAttemptGapUs (the guest sends hundreds of Reqs while loading: kTimeoutUs governs);
// anything else is final.
// Review 1 (S16): a trip only drops ONE window of 2873s: once decided, once its 2762 went out (phase Loaded) or
// kMaxAgeUs after its 2437, a 2873 of user 2 passes natively (a respawn or another path without a fresh F3 2283 is
// never swallowed). Review 2: the emission re-checks the phase (a 2174/2679 after the drop = "the trip changed").
// Review 3: no re-injection of the dropped 2873 on a final refusal (pendientes/p8-impl-viaje-rapido.md §12.8).
//
// P8 S27 (docs/research/s25/reaparicion.md): [session2] observer_milestone_reload_any = 0 | probe | 1. A revive
// (ReviveLoadingReq 2362 -> 2993 -> 2437 -> 2643 + 3066 -> 2988 -> 3053 + 2475 -> 2873) is the same reload in the
// same field (the 2362 arms user 2's own TS +0x569; 0x2BCA3D0 answers the 2437) but has no 2283, so no F3 trip was
// open and its 2873 passed natively: its 2322 went to the host's character and the guest stayed in load state 0x11
// for ever. With the key on, user 2's 2437 opens a trip whenever none is open (origin At2437), whatever Req started
// the load; it is classified exactly as an F3 trip (2643/3066 with no 2174 = reload; 2174 = field change, never
// ours; 2762 = over). probe: such a trip only ever says WOULD DROP / WOULD EMIT (its 2873 goes to the server).
// Whatever the key, the last 2437 of user 2 is followed and a 2873 handed to the server while that 2437's reload
// is unfinished (2643/3066, no 2174, no 2762) in the host's field is noted as a warning (log only).
// Review (d09254d): a trip only absorbs a later 2437 while it is younger than kMaxAgeUs (an old trip stuck in
// Asked / an undecided Reload is closed and a new one opens: else a later revive would be judged with the old 2437
// and pass natively).
