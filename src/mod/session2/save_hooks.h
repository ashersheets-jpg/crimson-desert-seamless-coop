// Option D, piece P6 (docs/OPCION-D-EMULADOR.md §4.6): while [session2] is
// on, nothing may change the host's saves. Inline hooks at the ENTRY of the
// KernelBase file functions (the game's imports and the CRT both end there)
// fail every write, delete, move, copy or attribute change under
// %LOCALAPPDATA%\Pearl Abyss\CD\save with ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED. Reads pass:
// the server loads the host's slot for user 2 in the first experiments.
// The policy is common/save_guard.h (unit-tested).
//
// save_guard=trace (session 24, lab only): the same hooks, plus
// FindFirstFile(Ex)W and GetFileAttributes(Ex)W, refuse nothing and log
// every operation under the folder after the original call
// ("Session2 save trace #N ..."), to design the redirected save from the
// game's real sequence. The saves are NOT protected in that mode.
//
// save_guard=redirect (session 24): at install the whole save folder is
// copied to %LOCALAPPDATA%\Pearl Abyss\CD\cdmp_save_sandbox (the previous
// sandbox becomes cdmp_save_sandbox_prev), then the same hooks plus the
// queries rewrite every path under the real folder to the sandbox and call
// the original with it (common/save_guard.h, Redirector): the game saves,
// loads and lists in the sandbox and the real folder is never written. If
// the copy fails the install falls back to block.
