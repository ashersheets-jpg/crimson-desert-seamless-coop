// P8 session 25, the guest's own save, PHASE B, the GUEST's side (docs/research/noche/progreso-invitado.md §3.2, §3.5,
// §3.6, "Implementado (fase B)"). The wire and the pure state machines: guest_save_wire.h.
//
// [session2] guest_own_save on the guest's PC: 0 (default) | probe | 1.
//   probe  at start-up its own worker thread picks the slot "Continue" would load (the newest save.save of 0-2 /
//          100-108 under save\<accountID>\), checks it as the game would (and refuses one with a slotN_new /
//          slotN_backup folder) and keeps it in memory; at the host's first control packet on a tunnel connection
//          it goes to the host (SAVE_OFFER + SAVE_CHUNKs, paced under 256 KB of tunnel backlog) ahead of every
//          packet of the client. The results
//          (SAVE_RESULT + chunks) are checked and stored by that worker in
//          %LOCALAPPDATA%\cdmp\guest_progress\<host SteamID64>\incoming\gen<n>\ (+ manifest.txt, the last 10 kept)
//          and acknowledged (SAVE_RESULT_ACK). The client's packets are never held, no Req is added.
//   1      the same, and the holds (gsw::GuestHold): the client's packets wait while the start offer is still being
//          prepared, its 3093 waits for the host's SAVE_ACK (30 s at most; then it falls back and tells the host),
//          a 3093 for another slot sends that slot's offer first, and its goodbye 2001 waits behind one
//          SaveToFileCurrentPlayerReq 2910 (slot 100, 'Co-op': a 3037 does not save now, guest_save_wire.h) for the
//          final save's SAVE_RESULT (15 s at most; at once when the server's 3016 says it failed) when the host says
//          the own save is
//          active.
// Never a write inside the game's save folder: tools/scripts/aplicar-progreso-invitado.ps1 applies a generation with
// the game closed.
