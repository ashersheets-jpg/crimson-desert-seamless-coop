// P8 S3, HOST: [session2] observer_hold_acks=1 (default 0; needs observer_hold=1)
// (docs/research/pendientes/p8-escenas-y-acks.md §3; the pure logic: observer_hold_acks_logic.h).
//
// observer_hold withholds an NPC's 2005 from user 2 until its controller gave it its first action,
// but the server keeps relaying that NPC's per-actor packets (StartSpawnActionAck 2723,
// ChangeAIStateAck 2404, ...) to user 2 meanwhile: they reach its client BEFORE the NPC exists
// there and are dropped (session 6B: 465 x 2723 with "2723 consumer 0", ~430 NPCs x 3 x 2404).
// With this key, in take_frame (session 2's Send, the game's threads):
//   - a held opcode (oha::kHeldOps, actor key at payload +0) for a key observer_hold withholds from
//     user 2's session is kept, in order, instead of being queued;
//   - the 2005 that announces the key (observer_hold's native re-announce, or the engine's own) is
//     queued, then right after it the key's kept packets in their original order;
//   - a drop of the hold (despawn, out of range, epoch, user 2 leaving) discards them (the client
//     would drop them: the NPC is not there); a release whose 2005 did not show up during its
//     NotifyAppear waits 2 s more; any hold ends after 40 s;
//   - bounded (1024 keys, 32 packets / 32 KB per key, 4 MB in all): over a bound the key's kept
//     packets go out at once in order and its hold passes natively (the behaviour without the key).
// Only for user 2's session as the OBSERVER: the controller of an NPC is never held (child_hold.h),
// and nothing addressed to the host's own client ever passes here. With character_hold=1 the host's
// main character withheld from user 2 is one more key (its 0xA key; the same opcodes, bounds and drops);
// needs observer_hold=1 or character_hold=1.
// Measures in describe; lines with the held/released/discarded keys (a few of each).
