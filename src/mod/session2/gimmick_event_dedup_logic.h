// P8 session 28: the duplicated gimmick projectiles (docs/research/s25/gimmicks-dueno.md section 7). The pure logic,
// no game access, so the tests can run it on S27's real bytes. Build 1.0.0.2976.
//
// CreateProjectileFromGimmickEventReq 2779 has NO controller gate on the server (0x2A3E370 -> 0x2BDD1D0(component,
// ...), the requester never compared with the gimmick's +0x90), unlike 2399 / 2202 / 2699 / 2612 / 2999 / 2387. Both
// clients send it for the same gimmick event, so the server creates the projectile twice (2250 index 1 and 2):
// 10 extra projectiles in S27.
//
// [session2] gimmick_event_dedup = 0 | probe | 1 (both PCs):
//   GUEST: every outgoing 2779 is decided against the controller the last 2005 record of its gimmick carried (as the
//     server sent it, before docked_gimmicks rewrote anything): known and NOT this client's user -> "would withhold"
//     (probe) / WITHHELD (1). Unknown controller or unknown own user -> never withheld. A 2779 docked_gimmicks already
//     withholds (its own-key rule) is not counted again: the line says which rule matched.
//   HOST: log only, whatever the mode: 2779 by origin (the host's client / user 2, at the server's receive) and key;
//     a 2250 with index > 1 caused by a 2779 that reached the server within kDupWindowMs, for a gimmick the OTHER
//     origin had also sent a 2779 for, is a "duplicate created".
