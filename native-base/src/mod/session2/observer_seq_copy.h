// observer_seq_copy = 0 | probe | 1, HOST (needs create_session=1 and [sniffer] enabled=1).
// observer_seq_copy_only = <hex sequencer ids and/or actor keys>, empty = every sequencer.
// observer_seq_copy_2322 = 1 (default) | 0: the host's last 2322 once per observer trip.
// observer_seq_copy_2100 = 0 (default) | 1: user 2's 2100 SyncStageCandidatePostionReq dropped while it observes.
//
// The host's own client's 2661/2981/2810/2322 (the sniffer's writer thread) feed a ledger; user 2's
// trip into the host's field (take_frame: its MoveFieldAck, as the server wrote the owner) turns
// the ledger into pending copies; each goes to user 2's queue (byte for byte, push_outgoing_extra)
// once every actor its 2661 binds was announced to user 2 by a 2005 in this trip and user 2's own
// 2322 went (or 30 s after its 2144); live 2661s become pending, a delivered sequencer's 2810 is
// copied. The C>S of user 2 about the host's sequencers (and its 2100 while it observes) are
// dropped on the network thread (offer). Pure logic: observer_seq_copy_logic.h.
// Since guest_seq_play (pendientes/p8-impl-escenas-play.md §5) also user 2's 2276 DeleteSequencerReq and
// 2105 StageBranchStateDelayEndReq about a host's sequencer, each with its own counter and line (user 2's
// own sequencers always pass; one about an id the host never got passes and is counted as "passed").
//
// observer_sched_copy = 0 (default) | 1 (pendientes/p8-impl-horarios-snapshot.md): on the same path, the host
// client's schedule stages: a fixed ledger of its live 2335s (and their 2958/2909) by scene key, emptied on its
// 2126/2411 and its own 2174; on user 2's observer trip a snapshot of it goes to user 2 once it finished loading
// (its 2549 or 2144), right behind the 2005 of each stage's actor, before the later NPC 2005s (unless that 2335
// reached user 2 natively first); live, a creating 2335 user 2 did not get natively the same way, and the
// 2126/2958/2909 of a stage user 2 has, unless the same payload just reached it natively. Its lines:
// 'ObserverSeqCopy [sched ...]', 'ObserverSchedCopy summary'. filter_req also sees user 2's 2549 (never dropped).
//
// probe: everything is decided and logged ("WOULD SEND", "WOULD DROP"), nothing is sent or dropped.
// Threads: the sniffer's writer (a mod thread), take_frame (the server's threads), the network
// thread (filter, tick). One leaf lock; under it only the outgoing queue's own lock is taken.
// Lines: 'ObserverSeqCopy [...]' from the network thread (tick), a summary every 60 s.
