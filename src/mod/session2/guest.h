// Option D, piece P8 (docs/research/opcion-d-p8.md): on the GUEST's PC, its
// game client talks to the HOST's game server through the Troc tunnel instead
// of to its own in-process server.
//
//   out: an inline hook at the entry of NwVirtualSyncSession::Send
//        (0x14380B0, the only client->server funnel) copies each frame to the
//        tunnel and hands the buffer back to Q3, as the server would;
//   in:  a mid-hook in the NetworkThread loop (0x35BAD4, every <= 16 ms) feeds
//        the host's Acks to ClientNet::OnRecvPacket, which copies them.
//
// The choice is made per connection: when the client connects (its 1001,
// a new epoch in [session+0xB0]) the tunnel must already be up, or that
// connection stays local (a normal single-player game). The client logs in
// as soon as the game starts, so the hooks go in from their own thread as
// soon as ClientNet exists, before the 1001; if the client already connected,
// it is too late until the game restarts.
