// Option D (docs/OPCION-D-EMULADOR.md §4.7, piece P7): raw game messages
// ("Troc" packets) carried between the two PCs, so the guest's client can talk
// to the host's in-process server as its second user.
//
// A Troc packet is what the game's packet functions handle:
//   u16 opcode | i8 slot | u16 payload_len | payload[payload_len]
// (troc-sintesis.md). Opcodes change between game builds: they travel as
// they are, both PCs must run the same build.
//
// Packets travel in batches, one batch per reliable message
// (proto::RelKind::TrocFrame), so delivery is ordered and exactly once, and
// a login burst of ~60 large Acks does not cost one message each:
//   u8 dir | u16 count | count x (u16 len | packet[len])
//
// Pure logic, no game and no sockets: unit-tested in tests/optd_tests.cpp.
