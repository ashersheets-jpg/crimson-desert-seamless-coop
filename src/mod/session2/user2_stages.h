//                    armed and the host within the off threshold (7 cells) of user 2 in the same field: user 2's manager

//   Review of ae14ab6: (1) arm / drain / cleanup under one module try-lock; the drain at P only with no Troc of user 2
//   in flight (user2_funnels_trocs_in_flight), and the Trocs that start meanwhile wait at their entry (bounded);
//   (2) with user2_drain_at_host_prepare=1 a DISTANCE drain waits for the host's pending preparation (at most 15 s);
//   (3) the NPCs given to user 2 still alive 5 s after a drain, at its load / goodbye Troc and at its character's
//   Logout are logged out (reason 25, inside SAM::FindActor's scope, key and controller checked); (4) a key the table
//   cannot track is not assigned, removed keys' slots are reused; (5) removed keys ignored by the checks; (6) only in
//   a Troc whose vf48 answered with user 2's own manager; (7) 'undriven' is a WRN line, not an abort; (8) P also
//   drains the stages an async drain left.
// Module thread (1 s): both players, the distance (same field only), the arm/drain decisions with hysteresis
// (>= 10 cells for 10 s / <= 7 cells for 5 s), the abort criteria (user2_stages_logic.h check_abort), lines
// 'User2Stages [...]' and a summary every 60 s. Hooks and game threads: SEH reads, atomics, a lock-free ring.
