// S46 phase 1, T2 in probe (docs/research/s25/s46-tenderos.md; tenderos.md §2.1, revision-diseno.md): the pure logic of
// [session2] observer_hold_scene_order = 0 | probe | 1 (HOST; "1" = T2 ACTIVE since phase 3, SceneHold below; needs observer_hold_acks=1).
// No game access: the tests run it on synthetic packets and on the real layouts.
//
// The fault [V] (p2b): observer_hold withholds the 2005 of an NPC from user 2 until its controller acts (344 / 375 ms
// for Renee and Rhett), but user 2's OWN 2661 that binds that NPC (types 4/5) goes at once: user 2's client creates
// the scene before the NPC exists and drops it (0xA9CA40, 0x3B331F28). Natively the 2005 comes 0.1-0.9 ms BEFORE the
// 2661 (34 of 34 shop scenes measured). T2 would keep such a 2661, and every later packet with its scene id, right
// behind the 2005s that announce its held NPCs. In probe nothing is kept: '[would hold scene]' says which scene, which
// keys, how long and which opcodes it would have held.
//
// Scope: user 2's own 2661 (owner @5 = user 2's character) of a trade scene (resource hash @27 in the trade list:
// smithy 0xA7132561, butcher 0x978345CA) binding at least one key observer_hold_acks holds now.
// Scene-id packets to user 2 (layouts read by the client's readers 0xC073A0 / 0xC07D00, ported from the other AI's
// guest_shop_order_logic.h): 2981 = 21 + 8 n (id @5), 2524 = 18 + 11 n (id @5), 2810 = 17 (id @4), 2661 (id @9).
// The 2005s are read as take_frame queues them (after observer_hold_acks' compaction, possibly batched: every record).
// Field boundaries for user 2 (the same port): 2174 = 17 + 0x38 n (actor @1), 2643 = 20 + 0x38 n (Co-op+ port 3549: 2653 / 2399, records of 0x38; 2976 48) (actor @1, append @19 =
// 0), 2756 (actor @0).
