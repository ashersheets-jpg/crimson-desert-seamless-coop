// P8 session 25, the guest's own save on the host, PHASE A (host side only):
// docs/research/noche/progreso-invitado.md §3 and "Implementado (fase A)".
// [session2] guest_own_save = 0 (default) | probe | 1, host only; it needs
// save_guard=redirect installed and healthy (otherwise it is forced off with
// one log line). The pure part (modes, slot rules, header check, decisions,
// generations) is guest_save_logic.h.
//
//   staging   ...\Pearl Abyss\CD\cdmp_guest_save_staging\<host account>\
//             slot204.incoming\{lobby,save}.save: a sibling of the save
//             folder and of the sandbox, which the game never lists. Phase A
//             fills it at install from guest_own_save_debug_dir; phase B
//             fills the same folder from the tunnel and calls
//             guest_save_incoming_ready().
//   LoadSlot  entry hook on 0x186F570 (mgr, int* res, u32 slot, actor):
//             user 2's loads go to slot 204 when it is ready; with nothing
//             ready mode 1 refuses them all ([0x6CF7CA4], the manager's
//             "busy"; its UserLogin too: its login fails natively) instead
//             of loading the host's slot. The host's loads always pass.
//   load      in the shared 0x20688A0 entry hook (identity_probe.h), for
//             "slot204" and user 2 only, inside a LoadSlot call this hook
//             remapped (so on the server thread, inside the manager's busy
//             section): <sandbox>\<account>\slot204 -> staging slot204.old,
//             staging slot204.incoming -> slot204, then the slot is
//             registered with the game's own functions GetOrCreateSlot
//             0x2355EC0(S, "slot204", 0) and AddFile 0x235B100(slot,
//             "lobby"/"save"). After the load the file object's header
//             (+0x98) must be the file's and the save guard must have seen
//             the read; otherwise user 2's save is POISONED (no more loads or
//             saves of user 2 in this run).
//   save      entry hook on 0x186E450 (mgr, int* res, u32 slot, character,
//             opts*): user 2's saves go to slot 204 once both files of ITS
//             current login were verified; otherwise mode 1 refuses
//             ([0x6CF7CA0], nothing written). The host's own saves always
//             pass. After a save of slot 204 its two files are
//             exported to %LOCALAPPDATA%\cdmp\guest_saves\<guest>\gen<n>\
//             with a manifest (the last 5 kept), and the result handler runs.
//   probes    every mode but 0: who calls 0x186F570 / 0x186E450 / 0x1871930
//             (FlushPendingSaveData), for which user, slot, result, thread.
